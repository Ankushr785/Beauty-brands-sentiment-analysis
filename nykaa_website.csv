"The formula of matte shades is good. The shimmery shades barely show up on medium skin tone. Pigmentation is average as compared to other products in the similar price range. Overall it is an average palette. There are better options available with other brands, or the new city mini palettes are also better than this.",2018-09-24 13:50:46,Makeup

"Hudas matte lipsticks are amazing and they now have these small sizes with multiple colours so we can try them all. The power pinks are great for any skin tone esp those with Indian skin. Icon and trophy wife are obviously the best but the other two are amazing as well. You can mix them up as well. They last all day, transfer proof unless your eating something oily. Extremely pigmented and doesn't dry out the lips at all.",2018-09-03 05:55:04,Makeup

"Bought iconic 1, great for light eye make up. Not gaudy, just right.",2018-09-17 21:02:20,Makeup
I have ordered Iconic 2 and it seemed used. The case was full of scratches and the back side was completely scratched upon. The brush had shades on it. Used !!!,2018-09-12 08:47:23,Makeup
Not a nice palette for the price. It just doesn’t blend and very stiff.,2018-09-10 15:57:07,Makeup

"So I bought the Iconic 3 palette, and before that I had the Romantic Smoked palette. I'm not the kind of person who uses eyeshadow for an everyday look, but if you do, then this would be a great pick. It's subtle and not too overwhelming. The colours in the Iconic 3 palette are really beautiful! I found it so much better than the Maybelline Nudes (The rose gold one). The Romantic Smoked palette, I used more than I thought I would. It's got more mattes, the pigment isn't great for eyeshadows in this one, but I've used the grey and brown shades to fill in my eyebrows a bunch of times. So I feel like I got the use out of it. The only thing, theres brands like Wet and Wild out there or even LA girl that have quads for a lesser price that I think are better, pigment wise. ",2018-08-28 14:12:53,Makeup

I really like this palette. Pigmentation is good. Colours are awesome. A good dupe for naked pallets. I own one as well. But why makeup revolution costs this much in India. They are charging us almost double the price in U.S. minus 2 stars just for the price.,2018-07-29 08:05:23,Makeup

"It was my 1st purchase of faces and lip colour too. My 1st shade was midnight rose and I really like it. That was the only reason I purchased more shades in just 20 days. Now I ordered two shades: (1) Irresistible pink and it is bright pink colour and I love this shade. (2) Majestic rose its shown in pictures like Little bit brownish colour in light shade but in reality, it is maroon in colour. Yes, it's nice but that was not that colour which I thought. Otherwise, I like faces crayons it's really pigmentated and matte and it stays for long and you don't need for touch up after lunch or dinner. I'm only disappointed with majestic rose shade.",2018-09-13 18:15:07,Makeup

Most of the shades have a warm undertone which suits Indian skin tone the best. Go for it girls!",2018-09-24 16:52:33,Makeup
This is the best foundation. Sometimes you may think that it doesn't fit you or it is Cakey. It is because you have not moisturised your skin nicely or you have not applied a good primer.,2018-09-24 15:01:17,Makeup

"This foundation works so well on people having normal to oily skin type
Like I'm one of them
and believe me
This doesn't allow the secretion of oil
Like I've used it the entire day
Tho after 3-4 hours of application, your spots and acne become visible
but it can control your oil secretion throughout the day
But those who with dry skin
please don't use it
as it can leave white patches after 2-3 hours of application which you won't like
so thumbs up for Oily Skin
and thumbs down for dry skin",2018-09-22 19:01:58,Makeup

I'm never disappointed with Maybelline products and so as this product. I have medium fair skin tone and it suits me also. Very worth buying and would recommend strongly for all skin types and skin tones...A big Thumbs up for this product...,2018-09-18 10:23:58,Makeup
"There are so many beautiful shades but it doesn't stay for long , you have to re apply it after 2-3 hours.",2018-09-17 19:25:13,Makeup
It's too dry and colour which I got is not the same which is shown here.,2018-09-17 18:34:48,Makeup
Using red rush...Beautiful colour blends like butter on the lips...But it's giving a little glossy look instead of matte...,2018-09-17 13:22:46,Makeup
"So finally I need to stop buying the Maybelline lipstick range. I have tried their all 24 hours stay, super stay, colour show, metallic all lipsticks but despite such a brand and such good creamy texture, the staying power is zero! So please stop claiming even.",2018-09-17 08:18:03,Makeup
It's a good orangish red colour..but it's semi-matte types..too good for the price,2018-09-15 13:17:45,Makeup
"It's a tricky red. but a good one. I love this color but I don't know why it tends to look pinkish after 3-4 hours on my lips. Also, it doesn't stick long for me. This one red can look good on any complexion. this is my everyday red.",2018-09-15 13:01:30,Makeup
"Pink power is a very light and ""patchy"" lipstick.I regret having bought this one! It mostly suits a very fair skin tone. I liked Rock the coral when compared to Pink power. This is also a light shade which has got a pink undertone and not so patchy.",2018-09-14 19:26:35,Makeup
Pink power is patchy and very light coloured lipstick. I regret having bought this one. It mostly suits fair skin tone. I liked rock the coral even though it's having a pink kinda shade. I prefer Rock the coral over Pink power.,2018-09-14 19:13:57,Makeup
Beautiful range by Maybelline. just love this color. matte finish. stays for 3-4 hrs,2018-09-13 19:59:37,Makeup

pros- affordable, good color payoff, doesn't smudge, matte and  easy to apply
cons- need to sharpen it which can cause little wastage of the product and can  dry lips 

quick tip- moisture your lips with a balm and then apply this crayon (works amazingly and doesn't dry lips)",2018-09-27 20:47:43,Makeup
1st it is not at all matte. Its like glossy and remove by hands with one swipe.,2018-09-27 18:06:06,Makeup

The texture is just like a crayon we use on paper. Soft and delicious smelling.however the color s are little different than picture not highly pigmented. However stays long unless you eat something oily. Pocket-friendly..so must try.,2018-09-27 11:38:56,Makeup
"This is an awesome nude color for fair to medium skin tones....might wash out deeper complexions...must try at the counters before buying online....but otherwise perfect for everyday wear and for no-makeup looks! it gives a creamy finish, quite light colored and it looks like my lips but a better shade! The only drawback that the size is extremely small and comes with no sharpener.",2018-09-27 09:06:21,Makeup
Affordable crayon.,2018-09-27 06:31:21,Makeup

"Very affordable. lovely texture, formula. glides like a butter. lakme know their lipstick game really well. I have the shade cinnamon brown- which is lovely everyday kind of a shade & can be used as a neutralizer on a dark shade lipstick.
another shade I have is shocking pink- is this really peppy pink color which just uplifts your mood. a very beautiful shade
definately recommend this.
atleast one shade from this range is definately worth trying it.
totally in love with these. thanks, Nykaa.",2018-09-26 16:51:14,Makeup

It's good. The colour is so rich and makes you look more beautiful. Just go for it blindly if you want to sparkle or impress. It lasts for a longer time and it's perfect matte!! So much love for it,2018-09-27 08:49:37,Makeup

"After reading so many positive reviews , I bought these 2 shades ... Well, I was looking for brown or mauve shades but these shade especially coffee lite is none of those. But unusually its combination of both. This is a very subtle shade kind of brownish purplish mauve.  It’s a very different shade. I like a subtle calm bold look. I am fair skin tone and it’s kind of look nude on me.  While plum feather is a popping vibrant pinkish red shade, kind of magenta. Gives you a perfect pop of colour.  The texture of lipstick is mousse kind creamy, easy to apply with a wand but it slightly takes time to dry. To transfer proof and smudge proof.",2018-09-24 15:39:21,Makeup
"This lipstick is my companion. I just can't go anywhere without carrying this lipstick with me. Be it a date or just going to college, this colour is perfect for every occasion.

Very matte yet so creamy. Lakme 9 to 5 has got the exact formulation that I look forward to lipsticks.the shade is very similar to Nykaa matte lipstick shade chai. The shade will suit from fair to dusky skin tones. I am going to rock this shade in a mint colored top. ,2018-09-28 09:20:48,Makeup

"Ordered this lipstick with lots of hope but it was not as per my expectations. The formula for the lipstick is really thin and after applying you can see your skin.

Ordered this shade..n it quite delivers the purpose.. it lasts for long and doesnt dry the lips much..application is smooth..But it seemed like a fake product looking at the logo on the bottle..,2018-09-13 19:43:06,Makeup

This shade is towards the darker side and suits my undertone. I have a wheatish complexion and I absolutely love how it glides on my lips.

"Good lipstick stays for 4-5 hours, not really matte.",2018-09-19 12:13:42,Makeup
I bought rust rage which is a cross between tangerine and coral. The colour is very unique- bright but not loud and can be worn on a daily basis. These lipsticks are more like velvet matte with a slight sheen and stay up to 4 hours with slight fading and light meals.,2018-09-19 06:27:03,Makeup

Longlasting...Nice fuchsia colour...best option to buy. I just love this shade and this range..totally amazing lipstick.,2018-09-20 09:54:59,Makeup
M04 Blush is the best shade for dusky skin tone and obviously for other skin tones too. It gives a pinch of wine colour to the lips which looks very attractive and of course the quality of the product is awesome.,2018-09-20 08:20:31,Makeup
"I had bought this from a store a while ago and even though I was bummed out that they didn’t have many light shades, muted pinks or peaches, I bought it because the salesgirl said it was the best matte lipstick they had so i tried it & it literally is smudge proof and so matte I love it I just wish they had lighter shades as I don’t like wearing dark lipsticks, but I would definitely order if they had more shades",2018-09-20 08:01:24,Makeup

"Have been using for a pretty long while.
(Hot hot hot 01 shade) the shade is a sexy bright red shade. The lipstick has a creamy satin texture. The lipstick is not totally matt and requires proper care as it tends to stick to teeth and over application can cause a leak of the product on your face.
 Its not kiss proof!
 Does not cause any allergic reactions. Doesn't over dry lips but still, lip balm is recommended as a base before application.

"I bought it after watching videos and reviews saying it a great nude. But on me, it's a nice soft red. Absolutely not nude but wearable every day because of its soft sheer tone. It's not matte. It's creamy and stays on for a good 5 to 6 hours without eating.",2018-09-17 06:19:20,Makeup

"OMG, THIS LIPSTICK IS AMAZING AND SO WORTH THE PRICE. A MUST BUY.",2018-09-16 03:15:44,Makeup
I re-purchased the shade Over The Top(B1V) a few days back from here and the re-order is not even close to the same shade I already have which is the prettiest brown with peachy undertones and definitely my favorite one. The one that I re-ordered is nowhere near brown but pinkish red which I would never use. It's just not my shade. Completely disappointed as the lipstick is a waste for me and I can't see a return option.,2018-09-15 14:24:48,Makeup
I love this product. I love the smell. I recommend this product. Please don’t hesitate to buy it.,2018-09-14 13:05:22,Makeup

Lipstick is not worth to spend this much amount. It's doesn't stay for an hour infact  it completely goes out when you eat or drink something,2018-09-18 18:08:04,Makeup

"I own three of these lipsticks; a nude, red and brown. let me just say that if you have always wanted to try liquid matte lips but are scared of it drying out your lips then just go ahead and buy these. when you first apply them they are runny but quickly set into their matte finish. it feels comfy on the lips and has a long lasting power. And the pigmentation is just great",2018-09-15 12:46:52,Makeup
I'm totally in love with this shade. Love you huda beauty. And thank U nykaa for getting this product in India. Gonna try more shades soon.,2018-09-13 19:45:16,Makeup

It’s not for long wear u need a touch up then and then . It leaves lipstick when I drink or eat something. I love the smell and the colour ❤️ . Unfortunately I got the product which will expire by October 2018 and I got this lipstick just a month ago.,2018-09-10 09:54:04,Makeup
I like that it doesn't crust up and lasts decently through a light meal. You can layer this effortlessly as well.,2018-09-09 08:27:00,Makeup
I brought this product after reviewing many swatches on YouTube but it is not for my skin type. Very nude colour one should go to the store and then buy. I wish someone had recommended the same.,2018-09-09 06:48:42,Makeup
Grabbed hand on this beautiful shade icon. The colour pay off was good but felt the formula a little runny and sticky. Overall nice color.,2018-09-08 22:15:27,Makeup
"I'm a sucker for lipsticks and buying one from the HUDA collection was an organic decision! I bought the shade Icon and I loved the texture and the pigmentation it offered. usually matte lipsticks tend to dry out my lips , but this one felt weightless and stayed on for over 6 hours! Application of a lip balm recommended before applying this lipstick though!",2018-09-08 13:03:23,Makeup

Best suit for a little dark complexion.,2018-09-24 17:38:11,Makeup
It gives a matte finish which lasts for 4-5 hrs without eating. The only downside is that it is very dry and doesn't apply smoothly on the lips which might end up in a broken lipstick. Good for every day and has a huge shade range.,2018-09-24 16:49:36,Makeup

It glides perfectly on lips. Stays longer. It gives a matte finish. It has a smudge tool on the other side. Though a little costly for the amount of lipstick it contains. Still must try.,2018-09-17 03:30:56,Makeup

"So I bought the Iconic 3 palette, and before that I had the Romantic Smoked palette. I'm not the kind of person who uses eyeshadow for an everyday look, but if you do, then this would be a great pick. It's subtle and not too overwhelming. The colours in the Iconic 3 palette are really beautiful! I found it so much better than the Maybelline Nudes (The rose gold one). The Romantic Smoked palette, I used more than I thought I would. It's got more mattes, the pigment isn't great for eyeshadows in this one, but I've used the grey and brown shades to fill in my eyebrows a bunch of times. So I feel like I got the use out of it. The only thing, theres brands like Wet and Wild out there or even LA girl that have quads for a lesser price that I think are better, pigment wise. ",2018-08-28 14:12:53,Makeup

"The formula of matte shades is good. The shimmery shades barely show up on medium skin tone. Pigmentation is average as compared to other products in the similar price range.

"It was my 1st purchase of faces and lip colour too. My 1st shade was midnight rose and I really like it. That was the only reason I purchased more shades in just 20 days. Now I ordered two shades: (1) Irresistible pink and it is bright pink colour and I love this shade. (2) Majestic rose its shown in pictures like Little bit brownish colour in light shade but in reality, it is maroon in colour. Yes, it's nice but that was not that colour which I thought. Otherwise, I like faces crayons it's really pigmentated and matte and it stays for long and you don't need for touch up after lunch or dinner. I'm only disappointed with majestic rose shade.",2018-09-13 18:15:07,Makeup

2. Fades beautifully. 
3. Shade range matches and suits a lot of Indian skin tones. 
4. Great price for a gift and love the magnetic cover.
5.  Nice pleasant scent.
Cons
1. Intially when I got it it had a layer of oil that had separated from the lipstick so initial application was a bit dry.
2. The packaging even tho is chic, is a little bulky.",2018-09-23 17:12:23,Makeup

"I finished over 2 bottles of this foundation. It is good for oily to combination skin. Gives a very natural finish. It is not full coverage though, its medium coverage which is buildable. Most of the shades have a warm undertone which suits Indian skin tone the best. Go for it girls!",2018-09-24 16:52:33,Makeup
This is the best foundation. Sometimes you may think that it doesn't fit you or it is Cakey. It is because you have not moisturised your skin nicely or you have not applied a good primer.,2018-09-24 15:01:17,Makeup
"Lightweight.
Semi Matt.
Medium coverage.
Good for all skin types.
Available in multiple shades.
Totally worthy.

"This foundation works so well on people having normal to oily skin type
Like I'm one of them
and believe me
This doesn't allow the secretion of oil
Like I've used it the entire day
Tho after 3-4 hours of application, your spots and acne become visible
but it can control your oil secretion throughout the day
But those who with dry skin
please don't use it
as it can leave white patches after 2-3 hours of application which you won't like
so thumbs up for Oily Skin
and thumbs down for dry skin",2018-09-22 19:01:58,Makeup
not full coverage but gives a sheer luminous finish.,2018-09-22 17:49:02,Makeup

pros- affordable, good color payoff, doesn't smudge, matte and  easy to apply

quick tip- moisture your lips with a balm and then apply this crayon (works amazingly and doesn't dry lips)",2018-09-27 20:47:43,Makeup

another shade I have is shocking pink- is this really peppy pink color which just uplifts your mood. a very beautiful shade
definately recommend this.
atleast one shade from this range is definately worth trying it.

"After reading so many positive reviews , I bought these 2 shades ... Well, I was looking for brown or mauve shades but these shade especially coffee lite is none of those. But unusually its combination of both. This is a very subtle shade kind of brownish purplish mauve.  It’s a very different shade. I like a subtle calm bold look. I am fair skin tone and it’s kind of look nude on me.  While plum feather is a popping vibrant pinkish red shade, kind of magenta. Gives you a perfect pop of colour.  The texture of lipstick is mousse kind creamy, easy to apply with a wand but it slightly takes time to dry. To transfer proof and smudge proof.",2018-09-24 15:39:21,Makeup

The colours are nice and the quality of nail polishes is also good.,2018-09-23 05:10:47,Makeup
I'm totally in love with almost all the shades in Matte look Nykaa is offering. The only drawback is that few nail paints they've sent are of 2017 and thus are close to expiry,2018-09-23 03:17:17,Makeup

Very matte yet so creamy. Lakme 9 to 5 has got the exact formulation that I look forward to lipsticks.the shade is very similar to Nykaa matte lipstick shade chai. The shade will suit from fair to dusky skin tones. I am going to rock this shade in a mint colored top. ,2018-09-28 09:20:48,Makeup

I had the shade Copenhagen which is a deep Maroon color. The formula is so comfortable on lips that I had to get more colors. I got the shade Berlin which is a brown color for medium skin tones. I love both the colors.,2018-09-23 04:02:30,Makeup
"My friends gifted me this from Nykaa and oh i love how it smells and how it is so smooth on my lips. Also, it doesn't dry out my lips!",2018-09-22 18:00:28,Makeup
Worst experience from nykaa today lipstick is very oily and remove easily.,2018-09-20 08:11:49,Makeup
"It is a really nice shade, not at all as brown as shown in the images but rather a much better subtle nude shade which compliments medium skin tone really well!",2018-09-19 12:53:02,Makeup
It is not of the same colour as shown in the picture.,2018-09-19 07:45:41,Makeup
Best lip cream. Matte loves it. Perfect on lips. Love it so much... satisfied. Nykaa the best place to buy.,2018-09-18 13:23:55,Makeup
I really like these lip creams but I ordered 2 new colours BEIJING and CABO and they turned out to be completely different...They are very light in reality and not as dark as they are shown... A little disappointed...,2018-09-18 11:53:30,Makeup
"I bought the shade, San Diego. The texture is very soft and good, but I'm very disappointed with the colour as it is not even close to the colour shown in the pic. I have fair skin tone and pink lips and this shade looks very pale on my lips.",2018-09-18 09:00:09,Makeup
The quantity of the product s too less and price for the same s unworthy.. kinda less satisfied.. but the shade s relatable to picture.,2018-09-17 11:03:06,Makeup

"I got the prague shade, pigmentation is okay. You need to prepare your lips before using this, like a foundation underneath, I had used a lip balm underneath on the first day and the color transferred to my tea cup. Two coats is a must for the true color to show! Too much effort to put during rush hours.",2018-09-16 05:45:20,Makeup
"Absolutely love the formulation and the shades Leon and Copenhagen that I use. it's really lightweight and creamy on lips. definitely worth the price. the shade Leon is a burnt orange shade, mix of brown with hints of orange. love it!! Copenhagen is a rich and a sexy shade with a purple and pink combination. perfect for a night out!",2018-09-15 17:53:58,Makeup
"Ordered this lipstick with lots of hope but it was not as per my expectations. The formula for the lipstick is really thin and after applying you can see your skin. On application of the lipstick..for a few seconds..it crusts around the corner, showing lines. After that it will give you matte finish.",2018-09-14 18:13:27,Makeup
Ordered this shade..n it quite delivers the purpose.. it lasts for long and doesnt dry the lips much..application is smooth..But it seemed like a fake product looking at the logo on the bottle..,2018-09-13 19:43:06,Makeup
Feels really smooth on lips... Amazing texture... One drawback... It dries off a little late... But it's flawless once it dries off!,2018-09-13 13:33:57,Makeup

This shade is towards the darker side and suits my undertone. I have a wheatish complexion and I absolutely love how it glides on my lips.

It's amazing that we can get such a huge range of colours at such an affordable price. The pigmentation is excellent but the colours may be deceiving here on the site because I ordered mauve date which here it looks like nudish but is actually more on the purply mauve.,2018-09-19 12:41:09,Makeup
"Good lipstick stays for 4-5 hours, not really matte.",2018-09-19 12:13:42,Makeup
I bought rust rage which is a cross between tangerine and coral. The colour is very unique- bright but not loud and can be worn on a daily basis. These lipsticks are more like velvet matte with a slight sheen and stay up to 4 hours with slight fading and light meals.,2018-09-19 06:27:03,Makeup

Longlasting...Nice fuchsia colour...best option to buy. I just love this shade and this range..totally amazing lipstick.,2018-09-20 09:54:59,Makeup
M04 Blush is the best shade for dusky skin tone and obviously for other skin tones too. It gives a pinch of wine colour to the lips which looks very attractive and of course the quality of the product is awesome.,2018-09-20 08:20:31,Makeup
"I had bought this from a store a while ago and even though I was bummed out that they didn’t have many light shades, muted pinks or peaches, I bought it because the salesgirl said it was the best matte lipstick they had so i tried it & it literally is smudge proof and so matte I love it I just wish they had lighter shades as I don’t like wearing dark lipsticks, but I would definitely order if they had more shades",2018-09-20 08:01:24,Makeup

"Have been using for a pretty long while.
(Hot hot hot 01 shade) the shade is a sexy bright red shade. The lipstick has a creamy satin texture. The lipstick is not totally matt and requires proper care as it tends to stick to teeth and over application can cause a leak of the product on your face.
 Its not kiss proof!
 Does not cause any allergic reactions. Doesn't over dry lips but still, lip balm is recommended as a base before application.

"I bought it after watching videos and reviews saying it a great nude. But on me, it's a nice soft red. Absolutely not nude but wearable every day because of its soft sheer tone. It's not matte. It's creamy and stays on for a good 5 to 6 hours without eating.",2018-09-17 06:19:20,Makeup

I re-purchased the shade Over The Top(B1V) a few days back from here and the re-order is not even close to the same shade I already have which is the prettiest brown with peachy undertones and definitely my favorite one. The one that I re-ordered is nowhere near brown but pinkish red which I would never use. It's just not my shade. Completely disappointed as the lipstick is a waste for me and I can't see a return option.,2018-09-15 14:24:48,Makeup
I love this product. I love the smell. I recommend this product. Please don’t hesitate to buy it.,2018-09-14 13:05:22,Makeup
Perfect casual nude shade. Must buy,2018-09-20 11:54:26,Makeup
Lipstick is not worth to spend this much amount. It's doesn't stay for an hour infact  it completely goes out when you eat or drink something,2018-09-18 18:08:04,Makeup

"I own three of these lipsticks; a nude, red and brown. let me just say that if you have always wanted to try liquid matte lips but are scared of it drying out your lips then just go ahead and buy these. when you first apply them they are runny but quickly set into their matte finish. it feels comfy on the lips and has a long lasting power. And the pigmentation is just great",2018-09-15 12:46:52,Makeup
I'm totally in love with this shade. Love you huda beauty. And thank U nykaa for getting this product in India. Gonna try more shades soon.,2018-09-13 19:45:16,Makeup

It’s not for long wear u need a touch up then and then . It leaves lipstick when I drink or eat something. I love the smell and the colour ❤️ . Unfortunately I got the product which will expire by October 2018 and I got this lipstick just a month ago.,2018-09-10 09:54:04,Makeup
I like that it doesn't crust up and lasts decently through a light meal. You can layer this effortlessly as well.,2018-09-09 08:27:00,Makeup
I brought this product after reviewing many swatches on YouTube but it is not for my skin type. Very nude colour one should go to the store and then buy. I wish someone had recommended the same.,2018-09-09 06:48:42,Makeup
Grabbed hand on this beautiful shade icon. The colour pay off was good but felt the formula a little runny and sticky. Overall nice color.,2018-09-08 22:15:27,Makeup
"I'm a sucker for lipsticks and buying one from the HUDA collection was an organic decision! I bought the shade Icon and I loved the texture and the pigmentation it offered. usually matte lipsticks tend to dry out my lips , but this one felt weightless and stayed on for over 6 hours! Application of a lip balm recommended before applying this lipstick though!",2018-09-08 13:03:23,Makeup

Like it...must buy...matte.,2018-09-26 12:38:12,Makeup
Best suit for a little dark complexion.,2018-09-24 17:38:11,Makeup
It gives a matte finish which lasts for 4-5 hrs without eating. The only downside is that it is very dry and doesn't apply smoothly on the lips which might end up in a broken lipstick. Good for every day and has a huge shade range.,2018-09-24 16:49:36,Makeup
Economic for college wear. Doesn't stay for long. Beautiful shades.,2018-09-22 17:06:26,Makeup

"It comes in a click style packaging, the stick slides out after you click the button, & after that it is like a normal lipstick mechanism. The colour is darker than it appears. It's more on the rust side, than the yellowish orange I was looking for. It is sheer enough to work as a corrector, but it's greasy so it's moves under the eyes. It's better for face than eyes. This might be a good option for darker skin tones, but not medium skin tones.",2018-09-05 14:58:51,Makeup
"It does a good job in pinpointed concealing, & to create sharper cleaner looks for eye makeup & lips, but it doesn't perform well on the waterline. Used as a brightener it skips & doesn't stay for long, it is also not soft enough for a comfortable application in the eyes. It needs setting, the formula is a little greasy (or emmolient) so overall its okay, but I wouldn't say you need to run out & get this.",2018-09-05 14:53:28,Makeup
"It’s very good, especially for the lips. You can use it to conceal and eyes as well.",2018-08-27 06:53:11,Makeup

According to me, it's not worth the price.",2018-09-10 05:41:13,Skin

It used to be such a hassle cleaning falsies and now it's not. This part makes me happier. It's cheapest of all the other brands that make micellar water and does the job well.

"I ordered this product after the excessive publicity by Garnier of how this is a different product from all other makeup removers out their. The product sure doesn't wipe away the makeup in one swipe, as the advertisement says. It took me a couple of swiping motions to remove my makeup which sure would irritate the skin if used in the long run.

I've been using this for a month and it has caused a lot of breakouts for me. This cream is not good for oily and acne prone skin. Even though it gives a matte finish immediately after applying you'll feel it's coming off once you start sweating. Above that this is available only in one shade so I'd suggest creams with a better shade range. I think Garnier is better.,2018-09-29 08:05:18,Skin

Congratulations to all of you people for whom this worked magically. But it was a big disappointment for me, unfortunately. My skin is very resistant to acne. But few days after using this, I developed reddish blotches around my nose and temples. I was so surprised and disappointed! I Discontinued use and regularly used green tea water to rise my face. Luckily, my most trusted method to treat skin worked again. Within a few days, my skin went back to normal. I had to dispose of the entire 20ml bottle. Nobody would use it. My 4000 bucks went to waste.
But I won't say this for everyone. All skin types are different. So sample everything first to suit your skin. Just my experience. Hope this helps.",2018-09-24 17:26:51,Skin

"I love this product mainly for its texture, which is gel-like but turns watery as you rub it.  I have a combination acne-prone skin with few bumps over my forehead and chin and it worked for me. The trick though is to avoid the bump/pimple areas.  the brightening effect isn't instant but gradual and personally, I notice the results after I followed it up with a proper toning and adding a serum to my regime. The result is soft, smooth and glowing skin with a subtle brightness.",2018-09-15 07:48:45,Skin

"This is the best sunscreen I've found for oily skin. It is so matte and it is tinted so it gives a bit of coverage but the coverage is really light, I have acne so it covers the redness on my skin so that little is the coverage. And it has SPF 40 and pa+++ which is good enough for every day. I apply this sunscreen in the morning and up to evening, my skin doesn't get oily as it used to before. very little oiliness I feel. It controls the oil really well but I would say don't apply this sunscreen on bare skin because it is really matte it may feel really dry on the skin. Oily skin people also moisturize before applying this sunscreen. Overall I would highly recommend this sunscreen it is best for oily skin people!",2018-09-09 10:30:01,Skin

"I just loved this sunscreen from Lotus. Like Maybelline knows their Muscara game best, Lotus knows its Sunscreen products game the best. I have used all of the lotus's sunscreens and many sunscreens from other brands as well, but I would say Lotus Herbals Safe Sun Uv Screen Matte Gel is the best. It gets absorbs onto your skin super quickly and leaves your skin completely matte, unlike other sunscreens. One thing though, since it is in the gel formula and it's not waterproof, so I would not suggest it to people living very humid conditions as it may wash off with the sweat. I never face any such issue as I live in Bangalore and that is why it is my favourite sunscreen. ",2018-09-24 17:46:54,Skin
Been using it for ages.Suitable for oily skin and amazing matte feel and great finish.,2018-09-20 11:25:51,Skin
I would strongly recommend this sunscreen since it is perfect for my skin type (I.e normal to oily). This stays for almost half a day. It is easily absorbed by the skin and you won't even feel that you have even applied anything. Sticky while applying but perfect when absorbed by the skin in about a minute. A small amount of it is enough and a reasonable price.,2018-09-19 15:34:58,Skin
"One of the most affordable sunscreen. The texture is non-greasy. It easily absorbs into your skin. I have oily skin and it worked just fine for me, no acne.

"Wonderfully removes any dirt and all sorts of makeup without doing any harm to your skin. I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin but I have faced no breakouts or anything rather my skin feels soft. No irritation if it gets into eyes. Still, I would recommend washing eyes with plain water once if the liquid enters the eyes. Small amt is reqd. You need not rub or pull your skin..just a firm swipe will do. Worth it.",2018-09-18 19:13:46,Skin

I've been using this for a month and it has caused a lot of breakouts for me. This cream is not good for oily and acne prone skin. Even though it gives a matte finish immediately after applying you'll feel it's coming off once you start sweating. Above that this is available only in one shade so I'd suggest creams with a better shade range. I think Garnier is better.,2018-09-29 08:05:18,Skin

"I am not that of a high-end person. And I swear this is the first and last high end product I will ever be owning!
Congratulations to all of you people for whom this worked magically. But it was a big disappointment for me, unfortunately. My skin is very resistant to acne. But few days after using this, I developed reddish blotches around my nose and temples. I was so surprised and disappointed! I Discontinued use and regularly used green tea water to rise my face. Luckily, my most trusted method to treat skin worked again. Within a few days, my skin went back to normal. I had to dispose of the entire 20ml bottle. Nobody would use it. My 4000 bucks went to waste.
But I won't say this for everyone. All skin types are different. So sample everything first to suit your skin. Just my experience. Hope this helps.",2018-09-24 17:26:51,Skin

My acne started to flare up the next day thanks to this ( I have combination skin ).

.
.
One of the worst products of Lakme. Just stick to Neutrogena moisturizers with SPF.",2018-09-19 11:07:53,Skin
"It's a kind of vanishing cream with a mild fragrance and very light pink in colour. Dries out after some time of applying, can be useful to control shine and sweat for some time. I apply it before foundation when I need to be free from sweat for hours.",2018-09-19 10:51:00,Skin
It makes the skin the too dry which further make lines and wrinkles.,2018-09-18 12:35:26,Skin

This is unlike other sunscreens which increases the sweating. This is like a great BB cream. Love it completely. Have been using it for the past one year. ,2018-09-16 04:39:28,Body

"This is a God sent sunblock. Just buy it. I have been using it since 2010, never used any other sunblock after this. worth every single penny.",2018-09-10 06:34:48,Body
"This product isn't so bad, it has a low coverage but it does even out your skin tone tho. It does give you a matte look especially if you have oily skin like me.. Doesn't cause breakouts. This is perfect for those hot summer days... Its tends to dry out the skin in winter, try using a skin serum underneath it to avoid flaky skin in winter.",2018-09-10 06:22:39,Body
"This is the best sunscreen I've found for oily skin. It is so matte and it is tinted so it gives a bit of coverage but the coverage is really light, I have acne so it covers the redness on my skin so that little is the coverage. And it has SPF 40 and pa+++ which is good enough for every day. I apply this sunscreen in the morning and up to evening, my skin doesn't get oily as it used to before. very little oiliness I feel. It controls the oil really well but I would say don't apply this sunscreen on bare skin because it is really matte it may feel really dry on the skin. Oily skin people also moisturize before applying this sunscreen. Overall I would highly recommend this sunscreen it is best for oily skin people!",2018-09-09 10:30:01,Body

I have ordered Biotique bio coconut cream for my mom and she applies this cream in night time before she goes to sleep. She really likes this cream as a night cream and we clearly see the difference it brightens the face after a couple of days ......It has mentioned that applies this cream day and night but I feel this cream is too greasy I don't think it is good for daytime or not but can be used as night cream you can also use this in winters also .....My mother liked it soo much and I am going to order another one from Nykaa.,2018-09-20 09:12:50,Body
It doesn't show result in the very first application but after a week you can notice your skin becoming very soft and bit of brightening must be used for a longer period of time for noticeable results.,2018-09-20 08:32:08,Body
"I had used this only once and I didn't really like it. The texture of this cream is oily and since I already have oily skin it didn't get absorbed and gave a greasy look. Perfect for winters when skin gets dry or if you have naturally dry skin but not suitable for sweaty summers.
I prefer the Bio white cream normal one that I bought from a local store (it is not available here I checked). That has a thin consistency and gets easily absorbed on the skin.",2018-09-20 08:30:03,Body
It makes skin soft but it doesn't suit my skin maybe due to summers. May be it will b good in winters.,2018-09-20 06:57:23,Body

"I just loved this sunscreen from Lotus. Like Maybelline knows their Muscara game best, Lotus knows its Sunscreen products game the best. I have used all of the lotus's sunscreens and many sunscreens from other brands as well, but I would say Lotus Herbals Safe Sun Uv Screen Matte Gel is the best. It gets absorbs onto your skin super quickly and leaves your skin completely matte, unlike other sunscreens. One thing though, since it is in the gel formula and it's not waterproof, so I would not suggest it to people living very humid conditions as it may wash off with the sweat. I never face any such issue as I live in Bangalore and that is why it is my favourite sunscreen. ",2018-09-24 17:46:54,Body
Been using it for ages.Suitable for oily skin and amazing matte feel and great finish.,2018-09-20 11:25:51,Body
I would strongly recommend this sunscreen since it is perfect for my skin type (I.e normal to oily). This stays for almost half a day. It is easily absorbed by the skin and you won't even feel that you have even applied anything. Sticky while applying but perfect when absorbed by the skin in about a minute. A small amount of it is enough and a reasonable price.,2018-09-19 15:34:58,Body
"One of the most affordable sunscreen. The texture is non-greasy. It easily absorbs into your skin. I have oily skin and it worked just fine for me, no acne.

So this was a random product I purchased because I ran out of my conditioner! I was planning to try it from a long time and got the chance. Its basically a leave in conditioner. So after using the serum I applied it and guys trust me its the best product ever made!! I used to have frizzy hair after a wash but after using pantene oil replacement I can see a good difference when my hair dries after a wash! Its a good quantity that is 180 ml for just Rs 120. Its a huge tube so if you are not planning it use that much do order the small one only. Its a highly recommended product with such effectiveness and low price as compared to high end products! It is also great for using before straightening or curling your hair. So invest in it for sure!,2018-09-20 12:46:35,Hair

I used an entire bottle and I can honestly say this has largely helped me in clearing up my skin. I love it only has three ingredients and man do I love how it actually healed my skin thoroughly. I suffered from skin rashes and itchiness since decades and now all that is gone, thanks to this amazing serum. I think it helpless I clean up and heal the inflamed pores and give a nice glow after consistent usage. I wish it had hydrating properties but then again it’s not targeted for hydration.

"I have been using Natural Vibes products for about a year now. After trying a variety of products and treatments, I stumbled across Natural Vibes and have been happy ever since. I recently bought the Serum out of pure curiosity. Since I had been happy with all their other products, I decided to give it a whirl. My routine was using the facial cleanser in the morning, followed by the toner and facial cream; at night I would use the Scrub/Mask in place of the Cleanser. I incorporated the serum into my skin care ritual at night and was thrilled with the results!

I was concerned that the Serum wouldn't moisturize my skin enough, but that was not the case whatsoever. After a few days of use, I noticed my tiny acne scars and discolorations fading, leaving my skin clearer with a more even tone. The results were so pleasing, I started using it twice a day, in the morning and at night, in place of the cream. In my years of battling acne, my skin has never been clearer! I am extremely happy with the Natural Vibes line, in general, and over the moon with the serum !",2018-09-06 06:22:00,Natural

"I just loved this sunscreen from Lotus. Like Maybelline knows their Muscara game best, Lotus knows its Sunscreen products game the best. I have used all of the lotus's sunscreens and many sunscreens from other brands as well, but I would say Lotus Herbals Safe Sun Uv Screen Matte Gel is the best. It gets absorbs onto your skin super quickly and leaves your skin completely matte, unlike other sunscreens. One thing though, since it is in the gel formula and it's not waterproof, so I would not suggest it to people living very humid conditions as it may wash off with the sweat. I never face any such issue as I live in Bangalore and that is why it is my favourite sunscreen. ",2018-09-24 17:46:54,Natural

I ordered this after reading the reviews and I m quite disappointed after using this. I applied it after washing my face and toning it.

You can't go outside after applying only this you need to put on some compact but if you are a non-makeup person like me or a school girl you can't apply this while going outside. I am a person with dry and sensitive skin but I just don't like the greasy appearance... people with oily skin just can't use it. when it comes to hydrating it gets absorbed in your skin really quick but you will feel quite a heaviness on your face. The fragrance is good but the thing is it is quite greasy and heavy on the face.,2018-09-15 03:20:32,Natural
My day start with this product...Everyday use best product...it also have spf...no need to apply other sunscreens...,2018-09-14 06:27:24,Natural

I have ordered Biotique bio coconut cream for my mom and she applies this cream in night time before she goes to sleep. She really likes this cream as a night cream and we clearly see the difference it brightens the face after a couple of days ......It has mentioned that applies this cream day and night but I feel this cream is too greasy I don't think it is good for daytime or not but can be used as night cream you can also use this in winters also .....My mother liked it soo much and I am going to order another one from Nykaa.,2018-09-20 09:12:50,Natural
It doesn't show result in the very first application but after a week you can notice your skin becoming very soft and bit of brightening must be used for a longer period of time for noticeable results.,2018-09-20 08:32:08,Natural
"I had used this only once and I didn't really like it. The texture of this cream is oily and since I already have oily skin it didn't get absorbed and gave a greasy look. Perfect for winters when skin gets dry or if you have naturally dry skin but not suitable for sweaty summers.
I prefer the Bio white cream normal one that I bought from a local store (it is not available here I checked). That has a thin consistency and gets easily absorbed on the skin.",2018-09-20 08:30:03,Natural

"It's a nice product, I have just used it once, I had some Whiteheads under my chin area which after the first use was comparatively less. The only issue I had is the peel off part. It doesn't come off in tiny small parts you definitely have to wash your face afterwards and it does leave skin softer and brighter. At this price, this is totally a steal!

The mask is of cheap quality and not worth the money.,2018-09-18 07:35:37,Natural

"It's a very good product. You can feel your skin smoother right after peeling the mask off. I personally did not feel much dryness in my skin. My suggestion is, keep your toner in the fridge, and after peeling your mask off, apply the cold toner on your skin. It will prove to be very soothing. 
However, what I don't like is the consistency. It is thin and the entire mask won't peel off in one go unless and until you use a generous amount on your face.",2018-09-11 02:44:31,Natural

The quality isn't very top notch, of course. Plus the organiser comes with a set of cotton pads too! I am done with the Gubb set of pads and realised that when I refilled this dispenser with the cotton pad column i bought from the local store, dispensing got smoother. Perhaps the quality of Gubb's own cotton pads was not good causing friction while dispensing.

It works as a moisturiser for me. Don’t expect it to minimise your pores it doesn’t even claim that (I think so). My skin is somewhere between combination and oily. It makes my skin so glowy and makes the makeup application so smooth. And yes I have used so many moisturisers especially which claims to be oil free and I don’t know about oil but those make me sweat a lot (I mean you can’t even imagine) but this one is so different. I love it. (Ignore if you have extremely oily skin),2018-08-07 21:54:40,Shaving

"So far I have used it on my legs. Make sure you follow the instructions well to get the desired result. I tried a small quantity on a small part of my legs for 5 minutes first as per instructions but my hairs are not fully removed so I increase the time for around 6 minutes and it worked well. You have to apply a good quantity if your hairs are more. The only down point I experienced is when my hairs started to grow back, they seem to grow facing different positions, facing the opposite of my skin, its like grass growing in a garden. Some hairs are facing towards left and some towards right :)",2017-03-03 12:43:27,Shaving

"I have been importing British Shaving Creams (Truffit & Hill and Taylor of Old Bond Street) for personal use costing anywhere from Rs 900 - 1800 per 150gm jars. They are supposed to be the Gold Standard of shaving worldwide.
Then I used the Biotique BioPalmyra Spa Shave Cream in a tub. No fragrance but gorgeous performer. Discontinued now, sadly.

Now this one beats the British. 
Mildly fragrant, super lather and amazing glide, lubrication and moisturization. 
This one excels during the cold monsoon and winters to the point that we avoid nicks / cuts that would be anticipated in such low temperatures.

Way to go biotique

Please produce a larger pack of 150 / 180 gms",2018-08-26 04:31:40,Shaving

"I use a series of shaving creams from Indian to foreign brands including taylor of bond street, Geo F Tumpers, Body Shop Macca root and many others.

Biotique Palmyra out performs all of these by a mile and some more.

It produces a lot of thick cushiony and slick lather for atleast 3-4 passes with just an almond size scoop.

The scent is extremely fresh and natural reminding of fresh coconut, palmyra and other natural scents. No chemical or artificial smells.

Post shave skin feels soft and smooth to touch. Highly recommended. ",2017-11-05 06:46:59,Shaving
