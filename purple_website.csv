its awesome,10/04/18,Lips
"The product is not completely matte but more of a creamy matte. I Chose the color plum but the color is not even close to what is presented in the picture. I have brown skin and the shade washes me away.
Talking about the formula, the color leaves stain after some time",03/04/18,Lips
"The shade partying with mascot is amazing.. If you love deep pinks with a hint of nude and plum, go for this... Perfect for office and college... Staying power is good... Not transfer proof though, but stays for 5 hours if you don't have oily or buttery meals... Moisturizing...",23/04/18,Lips

I bought this from a physical store a few days back. At first I was skeptical because of the wooden pencil and I assumed it would be hard to use. But this slides in like a dream you don't need to exfoliate your lips at all. It feel like butter on the lips. And the colour <3 Such a bright shade every girl's must have . It makes my face look bright and you don't really need any thing else on your face ! It's not a twist up though and you need to sharpen it so care needs to be taken to avoid product wastage. The color pay off is awesome as well. stays for 4 hours without any meals. A little pricey but a good amount of product is available so it's a decent. a,06/01/16,Lips

Color on the net and the actual product is vastly different hence it was a disappointing buy,02/01/18,Lips
"Highly pigmented, smooth in application but not transfer proof n if the mouth area is oily then the lipshade tends to bleed n spread all outside the lip area ...😒 otherwise good product! ",06/03/18,Lips
"Lakme absolute pout is a must try lipstick. Its totally different in its texture than other lipsticks available in the market. It really gives you a pout effect, if applied with a nice lip liner.<br/>However, as its a mat finish lipstick (which i actually like about it), use lip balm prior to applying this, on your lips to avoid the dry feeling.",17/12/15,Lips
very nice color but little bit dark,18/01/16,Lips
love the color at this price,02/11/16,Lips

Awesome lipstick.. Matte look..  elegant.. And No.1 Lipstick as of now available in India,25/08/16,Lips
"Loved the lipstick shade.
A perfect pinky nude for office.
Kajal is also highly pigmented and smooth.
Awesome deal",28/01/17,Lips
This is the first time I'm using sugar product. While purchasing I felt it's bit expensive. But I wanted to give a try. So I placed an order. It took nearly 6 days to get delivered. Coming to the product reviews the eye liner is pointed and thin. It's smudge proof and stays for long. The lipstick is awesome. it glides smoothly and non transferable. High quality lipstick. it's absolutely matte and don't dry out the lips. Now I know why it's expensive. Once in a lifetime have to try Sugar...,19/09/16,Lips
marry poppins.. one of the best shades of sugar.. in love it the color. superr hawt.. ?,29/07/17,Lips
I'm so in love with this stay quirky lipstick. It’s a rich mocha shade. I wear it on multiple occasions. It even suits my office outfits and lasts throughout the day.,26/10/17,Lips
Don't go for it. Lips starts to give shrinking feel and dry out. Color changed once it is applied to pale pink color. Very bad experience.,23/11/17,Lips

"in love with faces product, so far using Faces products only.. Nd this shade is really really pretty for all skin tone. mine is dusky and suits me really really well",26/03/18,Lips
"Dark Chocolate is an extremely beautiful color for all shades. But if your dusky (like me), this can be you next everyday-go-to color. About the transfer- proof: yes it is not completely transfer proof but its not at all gaudy in any way! If you're having a coffee or something, it leaves a very small trace. The fading out is very even throughout, and it even leaves you're lips a bit pigmented (in a good way) which gives a very natural fading out look (If you know what i mean :-P). It's amazingly moisturizing from the time of applying to the end (not even once did it dried or chapped my lips). So go ahead and buy this one girls, It's a keeper!",27/03/18,Lips
color is too darker,08/01/18,Lips

The color is awesome. Very light weight when applied on lips and the lipstick stays for long time.,25/02/17,Lips
"Transfers far too easily. Gets on food, the bit of skin just under my lower lip, clothes, EVERYTHING. Not matte, but it doesn't claim to be so--it is, however, quite drying. Also, lasts for a maximum of 2h. I bought it because the colour is honestly SO beautiful, almost universally flattering. It has a pleasant but strong fragrance. I wouldn't repurchase. ",05/03/17,Lips
"Such a gorgeous colour! It smells so yummy. The applicator is very convenient. I wish it lasted longer, as it disappears when you eat something.",01/07/17,Lips
Oh so refreshing. Not seen such a shade that I've seen. Pigmented and super water resistant. That's all I needed with an amazing shade.,09/12/17,Lips
Love the colour and the finish of it,18/11/17,Lips
I love Krishna Mehta and her collection is amazing. Now she takes over her lipstick and I'm here for it,23/11/17,Lips

Really good for the price 😊 But lacks lustre.. More matte texture.. Long lasting and can be used as a base for. Lip glosses ,20/02/18,Lips
This has been my favourite lip color from the day I first tried it. It is an amazing rosy pink liquid lipstick and will definitely suite people from fair to medium skin tones. The doe foot helps apply this lipstick very easily. It is extremely transfer proof and very  long lasting.,06/10/17,Lips

"mascara is ok in quality like any other mascara available in market.  No lengthening effect, obviously it makes ur lashes look more fuller but even a simple mascara does that.
consistency is very thick and product in the tube is very less. I had to move brush along the walls to find product even for the first application.",03/05/18,Eyes

"First of all, I would blindly buy a Maybelline product for the quality and reasonable price.
I purchased Volume Express Waterproof mascara as an extra precaution to save running mascara in times of rain.
Use this after using eye lash curler and steal the show.
Pros:
Handy.
Reasonably priced.
Waterproof.
Quite easily washable.
Brightens the look of eyes.
Instant voluminous lashes.

"At first I disliked this mascara, but there's a different method of using it. Never go beyond three strokes with this, or you will end up with spider legs. Dries quickly, stays put all day, is waterproof, doesn't irritate. Gives a slight boost to the lashes, not much. Curl your lashes for sure before applying to get the most out of it.",31/12/17,Eyes

"This eyeliner is the best one I have used so far. It is smudge free, long lasting, glides very easily, the tip is smooth and easy to apply, dark pigmented. I now prefer this over the Maybeline colossal liner which dried out pretty quick. ",04/01/18,Eyes
I am a college going student and have college from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm. I am obsessed with the look of a winged liner on my eyes and was looking for an eyeliner that will fit into my budget and give me good results. I was recommended this eyeliner by a friend and I kid you not tie eyeliner is the darkest matte black eyeliner I have ever used. It literally requires just one swipe and it gives an insanely dark crisp line. The liner is waterproof and lasts me the entire day without any touch-ups. The wand of the eyeliner is so comfortable to hold and the bristles are perfect to draw a wing in seconds.,07/10/17,Eyes

"It's good.. Especially if you got oily skin, as it doesn't go off easily like other products",19/01/17,Eyes
"I would rate it 4.5 though I really wish to give it 5 on 5. The only con I notice is its pricing, it should be a little moderately priced. Coming to the best features, it's lightweight and doesn't irritate your eyes. It is a dark black an very heavily pigmented, usually one stroke should be enough unless you want a very thick line. I have used many eyeliners bt this one is the best of all. Easy to remove as well, using a little warm water,  or a makeup tissue. it peels off easily.  It's  must buy, try once if you are a sucker for liners. ",18/09/16,Eyes
"On my second tube now. Favourite eyeliner, has overshot the Colorbar liquid liner in my esteem which I had repurchased four times. The applicator wand works beautifully and the formula is matte.",24/12/17,Eyes

girlssss. i am very pleased to write this review for kaya. This is the fiRST time I have ever used kaya products ..that too purchased it online. Ppl were like it might be fake so be careful or go to kaya clinic and use on their suggestion. But I was stubborn to use it and give it a shot. And I am glad I used it coz I can see a visible change in my skin just after 2 weeks. I accept its bit costly but then its worth it. Once you start using it you will see that u will have a glowing skin with out using any cream or anything.. all natural. For me my skin tone has also improved. I am very happy with this product. I use it with kaya skin tonic,28/04/16,Skin

It's a Just Ok Product... I didnt find it that much Magical according to its Cost...300 Rs. For this Product is too much...Its just like other Basic Normal 100 Rs. Or even less than that Face Washes...I didn't find much Difference,28/11/15,Skin
"It has micro beads for gentle skin exfoliation and it gently cleanses away dirt, pollution particles, grime and oil from the face. Never ever broke me out and the packaging is sturdy but a bit boring. This actually makes the skin soft, supple and glowing and the you get a lot of product for the price. A really good cleanser that does its job pretty nicely.",03/04/13,Skin

"The very first time I tried this, I was drawn to the aroma of the gel. Its fragrance envelopes you the moment it drizzles down the neck. I had to make little effort to keep my elbows, knees and ankles cleaner. Even with a normal loofah and a normal scrub, my elbows, knees and ankles were cleaner. The skin never felt better.
I am ordering it again.",14/03/14,Body

"very gentle cleanser. fragrance is same as that of sandalwood and does linger for a few mins after shower. skin feels fresh soft and supple which is great.   I have only one complain that ingredients list must contain all ingredients as I (and many other out there) are people with v sensitive skin so that we can buy confidently. apart from this, thumps up for this shower gel. would love to try other variants too if I know they are free from all harmful chemicals.",27/04/18,Body

This strawberry shower gel is highly moisturizing and nourishing on my skin. It makes my skin feel frsh and lively. I brought this since strawberries contain salicylic acid which is known for getting rid of dead cells from the skin and tightening the pores. ,19/11/17,Body
"The gel is light pink in colour , runny in consistency. The smell of it is very mild and not at all long lasting. It foams a little but a small amount is enough to clean the body. The best part about this body gel wash is that it’s extremely hydrating. Body doesn’t feel dry or rough after using this gel.",15/12/17,Body
"This strawberry shower gel fights free radicals. This shower gel gently cleans my skin, giving it the hydration it needs. It gives my skin a natural glow from within.

"Hair type- thin, straight & long. Dry and split ends.
Scalp- oily and occasional dandruff.
This shampoo is A M A Z I N G.
I have used Schwarzkopf, l'oreal, wella, sunsilk, Garnier, tresme and what not! These shampoos did no good to my hair and in turn made them dry and lifeless.
I came across this shampoo while looking for scalp treatment and thought to give it a try n I am glad that I did!
It has made my hair extremely lovely in just one wash.
The shampoo smells like ACV and its thick in consistency. I diluted it with water and then applied on my scalp and left it for good 10minutes. After that I didn't apply any conditioner or serum coz I wanted to know the. Exact effect of this shampoo. Trust me guys...this did wonders!!!!
I can't thank this brand enough for launching this sls paraben free shampoo which beats high end salon products. My hair feels smooth ,silky, shiney and lovely.
wish I could attach pictures here for you all.
 Now this is my Staple shampoo and I am going to try their conditioner pretty soon.",13/08/17,Hair

I have been using  this shampoo for almost 6 months now and I have already purchased it twice and will be repurchasing it again. Although the smell of this shampoo is not at all good (it smells like naphthalene) yet it is a very good shampoo. It is mild but cleanses your hairs well. It has controlled my hair fall to some extent and it adds shine to the hairs once the hairs dries up completely. It is one of my HG hair care product.,15/05/15,Hair

this shampoo is highly moisturising n nourishing on hair. the smell is totally like Banana shake but it doesn't linger after wash which is good for sensitive noses. though this shampoo contains a derivative of SLS yet I would say this is a real deal at this price... worth trying,31/12/17,Hair
